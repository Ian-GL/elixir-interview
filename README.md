This is a repo that contains examples of common interview questions made with Elixir.

Currently the excercises are:
```
-  FizzBuzz
-  Find most repeated character in a string
-  Find the first repeated character of a string
-  Check if a string containing parenthesis and braces has logic
-  Given an hour as a string (hour:minutes), return the angles of clock hands

```
